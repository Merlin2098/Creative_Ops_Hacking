# Creative_Ops_Hacking
"When the system isn't built for you, you can build your own system." This repository is the result of thinking with logic, automating with purpose, and using AI as an extension of my creative capacity. You don't need to be a pure engineer to solve technical problems, just have intention, courage, judgment, and the right tools.
